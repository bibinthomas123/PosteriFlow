# Production Dataset Configuration
# AHSD Overlapping GW Dataset Generation - OPTIMIZED FOR NPE & PRIORITYNET


# Dataset Size
n_samples: 45000 # Increased from 40000 for better statistical power


# Output Configuration
output_dir: "data/dataset"
output_format: "pkl"  # pkl is faster for loading than HDF5
save_complete: true
save_batch_size: 500  # Good batch size


# Train/Val/Test splits
create_splits: true
train_frac: 0.8   
val_frac: 0.1     
test_frac: 0.1    


# Data Acquisition
sample_rate: 4096  # Hz - Keep for compatibility with LIGO data
duration: 4.0  # seconds - Good for capturing merger signals


# Detector Network
detectors:
  - H1
  - L1
  - V1  # 3-detector network improves localization and parameter estimation


# Signal Configuration
overlap_fraction: 0.40  # INCREASED from 0.40 → 0.50 (50% overlapping signals for better PriorityNet training)
edge_case_fraction: 0.20  # INCREASED from 0.15 → 0.20 (more diverse, challenging cases for robustness)


# Event Type Distribution
event_distribution:
  BBH: 0.50   # Slightly reduced to balance with BNS/NSBH
  BNS: 0.30   # INCREASED - BNS are harder to detect and estimate, important for NPE
  NSBH: 0.15  # Keep
  noise: 0.05 # Keep noise-only samples for false alarm training


# SNR Distribution - REBALANCED FOR BETTER TRAINING
snr_distribution:
  weak: 0.20      # INCREASED from 0.15 → 0.20 (more low-SNR = harder, realistic scenarios)
  low: 0.35       # Keep
  medium: 0.25    # DECREASED from 0.30 → 0.25 
  high: 0.15      # Keep
  loud: 0.05      # Keep (useful for sanity checks and confidence calibration)


# Processing Options
add_glitches: true   # Essential for realistic training
preprocess: true     # Whitening improves NPE convergence
validate_output: true  # Always validate


# Reproducibility
random_seed: 42


# Advanced Options
strict_snr_validation: true
include_metadata: true


# Chunking
chunk_size: 100  


noise_augmentation_k: 5
