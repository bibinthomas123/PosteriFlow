For METHODS Section:

"Our training dataset exhibits moderate distance-SNR correlation for BBH systems (r = -0.586), consistent with the amplitude ∝ 1/distance relationship and well-documented GW selection effects. This selection function reflects realistic LIGO O3 detection sensitivity."​

For DISCUSSION Section (where this paper fits):

"Recent observational studies demonstrate that mass and redshift distributions are fundamentally coupled to detector sensitivity [this paper, 13, 18], with predictions that higher-redshift observations will exhibit different selection patterns. Extending our framework to next-generation detectors (ET, CE) will require accounting for these evolving population properties."
